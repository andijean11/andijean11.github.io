<p> Translator's note: "I'm playing with epigrams. This is a new poetic form and genre for me, and I find it trick to know what to do with
  them- they're born out of a tradition of actual stone/material inscriptions (funerary, dedicatory, or otherwise). By the time Erinna and Nossis
  are writing, epigrams have become a literary genre of the page. With these, I'm playing with the reading-experience and attempting to call
  extra attention to the written word and its material, or in this case digital, presence in a way I think interested the Helennistic poets, too.
