    <h1> About this Project</h1>
    <br><p> This website was made possible by the University of Iowa Libraries
      Digital Scholarship &amp; Publishing Studio, and their Summer Fellowship Program,
      supported by the University of Iowa Graduate College and the Studio Steering Committee.
      The fellowship allowed nine graduate students to work on "digital publishing"
      in whatever form it took as it applied to their field of study over an eight week period
      in the summer of 2017. <br><br>
      My idea was to generate a new type of translation website that did more than
      show the original and the translation side-by-side. With digital media, "readers"
      can become "users," actively involved in the reading experience. Translation
      is a series of complicated decisions, and I invite you to explore the decision processes
      I go through when I translate from French. This exploration includes examining the usefulness
      and the limits of Machine Translation (namely Google Translate).<br><br>
      In addition, I hope to create a space where translations can move beyond pen and paper.
      I have featured three poems by Laura Moser whose ideas are enhanced by digital features. <br><br>
      Finally, I invite you to read through my blog, which relies on the use of images to
      communicate my thoughts as I work on this project. </p>

    <h1>About Andrea </h1>
    <br>
    <p> Andrea received her Bachelor of Arts in English and French with a European Studies
      Concentration from Grinnell College in 2015. There, she was both a French tutor and
      lab assistant. She also was a research assistant on a project involving Wagner's influence
      on the music culture of late nineteenth century France. During her junior year,
      she studied abroad in Nantes, France with the IES program. During the 2015-2016 academic year,
      she served for Americorps in North Minneapolis teaching literacy skills to at-risk third graders.
       She is currently an MFA student in Literary Translation; she translates from French to English,
       primarily from Francophone Caribbean literature. She also teaches for the Department of French
       at the elementary and intermediate levels. When she isn't reading, she is playing her
        cello, trying a new recipe, playing video games, or planning her next vacation. </p>
