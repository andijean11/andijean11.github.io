<h4> EXPERIMENTAL TRANSLATIONS</h4> <cite> July 17, 2017 </cite>
<br><br>
<p>As I begin the sixth week of this fellowship, I'm starting to hit a groove! I've learned
a lot of coding strategies. The first week I had ideas and I was trying to pick and choose
bits of code that would accomodate, but now that I've dedicated much more time to learning
a large breadth of coding, I can take what I want to do and think of multiple ways to accomplish it.
 </p><p> This is especially important when working on my experimental translations. In addition
   to exploring translation theory by exposing the two languages (original and target) to the reader
   in an interactive way, I believe that digital publishing has the capability to produce interactive
   text that isn't possible on paper. This is more similar to E-Poetry, and I'm trying to bring it to
   translation. </p>
   <p> That's why I decided to incorporate Laura Moser's translations into this first stage of
     my website. She is also a student here at the UIowa MFA in Literary Translation program. Her
     translations of Ancient Greek and Latin poetry incorporate imagination and ingenuity. She focuses
     on bringing the translation-reading experience onto the page. I feel there is a lot of potential
     in her work and in other works like this if we open it up to the internet. </p>
     <p> Of course, experimental digital translation is not my invention. Two notable websites include
       http://www.yhchang.com/ and www.85bawu.com. YHChang uses flash animation to control the speed
        of the text, manipulating the reader's experience. And The 85 Project  uses art across media to
         bring a physical existence to translations. What if translations were art instead of text? </p>
    <p> I hope my website offers another space for experimental translations. Without going so far as
       3D printing algorithms into benches, I hope these poems invite readers to expand their mindset
        about what the process of translation is and what translations can look like. </p>

<h4> CODING</h4> <br> <cite> July 12, 2017 </cite>
<br><br>
<p> Hello again blog readers! Although I know that's a bit gratuitous since, as of now,
this website is only accessible by me because it's saved locally on a harddrive. So I'm being
a bit silly. </p>
<p> I've been learning so much coding my head hurts. As per my sister's recommendation,
  I used <a href="https://www.codecademy.com"> Codecademy</a> to review html, JavaScript,
  and CSS, and to learn Bootstrap and JQuery for the first time. I really enjoy the free
  lessons that teach you how to code. If you do the 'building a website' one, you'll
  probably notice that my website looks very similar, at least in this early stage.
  Codecademy gave me the tools to read a code and understand everything it was doing,
  instead of blindly cutting and pasting a template.</p>
  <p> I was introduced to coding just by being a preteen in the early 2000s; you needed
    small amounts of html to customize your myspace page (and my Neopets shop!). I did
    online role-play storytelling with other teens and how else do you customize
    your font except with html? However, that was about the extent of it.</p>
    <p> In college I took intro to Comp. Science where they taught us Scheme, this verify
      old and recursive language. Here's some code I'm still proud of that turns any given
      image into black and white, because I got
      extra credit for its consision: <blockquote>
        (define monochrome
  (lambda (image lens-color)
    (image-variant image
                   (lambda (rgb)
                     (let ((modified-rgb-components-sum
                            (+ (* 0.30 (rgb-red rgb))
                             (* 0.59 (rgb-green rgb))
                             (* 0.11 (rgb-blue rgb)))))
                       (rgb-list->rgb (map (o (l-s *  0.5)
                                              (l-s + modified-rgb-components-sum))
                                        (rgb->rgb-list lens-color)))))))) </blockquote>
    <p> The professor said I had an aptitude for coding but that was about the end of it.
      I had to learn a little php for the employee portal I managed as a student manager,
      but again, that's about it. </p>
      <p> Learning how to build this website has been rewarding and frustrating. I know
        that it has a lot of bugs. If one day this website is actually worth its salt,
        maybe I'll go back and fix those things, but for now, it serves its purpose. </p>
        <p> Soon I'll get some actual doodles on here, because I'm a very visual thinker,
          and I believe in the power of comics to make complicated ideas accessible.</p>

  <h4> THOUGHTS ON DIGITAL TRANSLATION </h4><cite> June 29, 2017 </cite>
  <br> <br>
  <p>Hello blog readers! I’m Andrea, one of the fellows in the UIowa Digital
    Scholarship &amp; Publishing Studio this summer. I’m in the middle of the
    MFA in Literary Translation Program at UIowa, and I translate from French to
    English. This summer I’m working on a website that includes some translations
     with digital features, inviting the reader to think like a translator and
     explore how translators make decisions. For this post, I’m going to throw
     out some ideas that I’ve been mulling around in my head regarding Machine
     Translation.I could conduct research and practice digital translation for
      the next ten years and still not be done, and the research from my first
      year would become obsolete by the end of the decade. This may seem daunting,
      but for me, young and naïve 23-year-old academic who still doesn’t drink
       caffeine, the potential of this field is exciting. <br> <br>
       I’ve been reading a lot of theory recently about machine translation and
technology, specifically Google Translate which has gained dominance in the
last five years. I love the ways these articles/essays both underscore and
undermine traditional translation theory. Translation theory is thus incredibly
 dynamic, constantly altered by the technologies that necessitate and facilitate
  its existence.<br> <br>The field of translation is growing, and so is the
  fear that one day we translators will be completely replaced by Translation
   Machines. If you’re not scared yet, read about Google Translate’s
   new<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2126738-google-uses-neural-networks-to-translate-without-transcribing/">
     “Neural Machine,”</a> which debuted last fall and
     <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2017/03/06/googles-smarter-a-i-powered-translation-system-expands-to-more-languages/">
       is gaining traction in new languages</a>. A brief quote that explains
       how it works:<blockquote><em>“The team trained its system on hundreds
         of hours of Spanish audio with corresponding English text. In each case,
         it used several layers of neural networks – computer systems loosely
         modelled on the human brain – to match sections of the spoken Spanish
         with the written translation. To do this, it analysed the waveform of
         the Spanish audio to learn which parts seemed to correspond with which
          chunks of written English. When it was then asked to translate,
          each neural layer used this knowledge to manipulate the audio waveform
          until it was turned into the corresponding section of written English.”</em></blockquote>
In other words, it’s translating “wave-to-wave” instead of “word-to-word.”
This is a translation on a neurological level, not just a transcription of
bilingual dictionaries. The emphasis is on accuracy of meaning without the
obstacle of the words themselves.<br> <br>And, if you thought that Google had
the monopoly on machine translation, just this week
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/amazon-said-to-be-working-on-translation-services-for-aws-customers/">
  Amazon announced working on its own Machine Translation services</a>.<br> <br>
I entered this program at UIowa because it seemed like a perfect fit for my
interests in French literature. But will the skills I gain here be superseded by
Machine Translation? Will my career be safe (if it was even safe in the first place)?
 Should I consider pursuing other fields?<br> <br>Something I like to tell myself:
  “Machines will never be able to fully grasp a literary text’s meaning, its artistry,
  or its historical, cultural, and etymological context.”<br> <br>

“Maybe, maybe not,” I cynically respond. Imagine a Google translate of the future
 that allows settings for input and output. Translate one of Basho's haikus into
  “teenage German vernacular.” Translate <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> into “Latin,
  in the style of Cicero.” Translate Kafka’s <em>Metamorphosis</em> to English
   using predominantly Anglo-Saxon words. What if one day Machine Translation has
   this ability to alter its algorithms to include stylistic input and output? I
   don’t think this is impossible. After all, Google Translate learns from its usage.
   The more translations that are run through it, the stronger it gets, and the
   smarter the translators get, the smarter it gets. With the right upkeep,
   it will always have more memory, more resources, more algorithms than its
   human counterparts.<br> <br>
Many translators, including myself, sometimes use Google Translate for reference,
 and after getting a rough draft of an excerpt, they work from there to imbue the
 text with the elements “lost in translation.” If Machine Translation can help us
 translate more efficiently, without completely taking over our careers, we should
 celebrate its consequence: the increase of world literature available in English.
  As translators, isn’t that our ultimate goal?<br> <br>

So what does the future look like for translators? Will we become obsolete
(or when?)? Will we have to pursue careers managing and coding Translation Machines?
 I can’t say. For now, Google Translate is unable to capture style, rhyme, and rhythm;
 it can only reproduce meaning. For now, Translation Machines are unable to adequately
  compute the artistic qualities of texts. <a href="http://www.k-international.com/blog/human-translation-vs-machine-translation-contest/">
    For now, human translation prevails</a>.<br> <br>

Maybe one day Translation Machines will be able to interpret a text’s beauty.
Until then, we need tech-savvy human translators working on world literature.
 Until then, we need innovative and passionate translators to do what Machines cannot. Until then, I’ll be translating.
